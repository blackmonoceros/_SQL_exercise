Exercises for the previous code antiquarian bookstore.

1) SQL sentence that will print Book_id and Title
(ONLY THESE COLUMNS) from the Books table, where we are only interested in
books with a title starting with the letter "S" and the original language Polish
(the Original_language column has the text 'Polish') as well as those books that
do not have an original language entered (regardless of their title).

2) SQL sentence that will print Book Title and
Author's Last Name and First Name1, where we are only talking about books by authors
born before January 1, 1980 (1980-01-01).

3) Let's assume that the Authors table has been entered with data of certain
authors whose books we do not yet have in the database. SQL sentence
that will display the Last Name and First Name1 of all those authors whose
books we do not yet have in the database (this can be done in various
ways).
4) An SQL sentence that will print out for each genre
the titles of all books in that genre. The result set should
contain the following columns: Genre_id, Genre_name, Title, and Author_id.

5) An SQL sentence that will print out for each author
(author_id is enough, no other data should be provided) how many books the author
has written with a title starting with the letter 'A' (this is not about
copies, only titles, so this is about data from the Books table), where we are only
interested in those authors who have written more than three such books..
